Reliable Data Transfer Protocol
Adam Chaulk and Yang Lu

To build the project, run "make all" in the command line.

The purpose of this project was to implement both GBN and Selective Repeat transfer protocols. We were only able to 
complete a partial implementation of GBN, as we started the project in C++ and had to revert many of our changes.

To run the server, run: "./server gbn windowSize lossRate". Next, start the server with /start
TO run the client, run: "./client gbn windowSize lossRate" and type /connect localhost and /help for available commands. 

For the distribution of the work, we pair programed for this assignment.
